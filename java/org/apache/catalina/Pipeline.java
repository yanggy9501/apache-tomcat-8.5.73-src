/**
 * <p>Interface describing a collection of Valves that should be executed
 * in sequence when the <code>invoke()</code> method is invoked.  It is
 * required that a Valve somewhere in the pipeline (usually the last one)
 * must process the request and create the corresponding response, rather
 * than trying to pass the request on.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is generally a single Pipeline instance associated with each
 * Container.  The container's normal request processing functionality is
 * generally encapsulated in a container-specific Valve, which should always
 * be executed at the end of a pipeline.  To facilitate this, the
 * <code>setBasic()</code> method is provided to set the Valve instance that
 * will always be executed last.  Other Valves will be executed in the order
 * that they were added, before the basic Valve is executed.</p>
 *
 * 责任链模式: 管道
 * Pipeline 中维护了 Valve 链表,Valve 可以插入到 Pipeline 中
 * Pipeline 中没有 invoke 方法，因为整个调用链的触发是 Valve 来完成的，Valve 完成自己的处理后，调用 getNext.invoke() 来触发下一个 Valve 调用。
 *
 * 每一个容器都有一个 Pipeline 对象，只要触发这个 Pipeline 的第一个 Valve，这个容器里 Pipeline 中的 Valve 就都会被调用到。
 * 但是，不同容器的 Pipeline 是怎么链式触发的呢，比如 Engine 中 Pipeline 需要调用下层容器 Host 中的 Pipeline。
 *
 * 这是因为 Pipeline 中还有个 getBasic 方法。这个 BasicValve 处于 Valve 链表的末端，它是 Pipeline 中必不可少的一个 Valve，
 * 负责调用下层容器的 Pipeline 里的第一个 Valve
 *
 *
 * 整个调用过程由连接器中的 Adapter 触发的，它会调用 Engine 的第一个 Valve
 * Wrapper 容器的最后一个 Valve 会创建一个 Filter 链，并调用 doFilter() 方法，最终会调到 Servlet 的 service 方法
